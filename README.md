# PantryIntelligence
It's rather common to find people who buy food that they don't need while unwittingly forgetting those that they should. Sometimes you may not get enough fiber in your meal and other times you may find yourself wondering whether you already have pasta in your pantry. Hence, we introduce to you PantrI, short for Pantry Intelligence. PantrI uses Google Firebase's database API along with receipt scanning APIs to enable users to take pictures of their grocery receipts to keep track of their stock as well as average daily nutrient intake. With PantrI, users can live a fulfilling and healthy life while saving money on unnecessary groceries.
